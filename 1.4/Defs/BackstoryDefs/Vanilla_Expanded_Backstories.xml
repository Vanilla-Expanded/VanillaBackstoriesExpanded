    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up with a thirst for knowledge, be it for science, history, or philosophy. Running off into the wilderness, [PAWN_pronoun] would spend as much time learning from nature and the ruins that [PAWN_pronoun] would find.

Over time, [PAWN_pronoun] became more reclusive, and mainly found solace in [PAWN_possessive] work. </baseDesc>

Granted [PAWN_pronoun] ended up on the run because [PAWN_possessive] Ratburgers attracted the taxman, but [PAWN_pronoun] found it fun while it lasted.</baseDesc>
